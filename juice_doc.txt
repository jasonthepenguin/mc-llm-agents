Config
Modify config.yml:

hostname: - ip address or hostname to allow connections from, default is "0.0.0.0" (any). "localhost" would prevent remote clients from connecting.
port: 4711 - the default tcp port can be changed in config.yml
location: RELATIVE - determine whether locations are RELATIVE to the spawn point (default like pi) or ABSOLUTE
hitclick: RIGHT - determine whether hit events are triggered by LEFT clicks, RIGHT clicks or BOTH
Libraries
To use the extra features an modded version of the java and python libraries that were originally supplied by Mojang with the Pi is required, github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice/tree/master/src/main/resources/mcpi.

You only need the modded libraries to use the extra features, the original libraries supplied with Minecraft Pi edition still work, you just wont be able to use the extra features
